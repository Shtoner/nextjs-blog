This was started as a starter template for Next.Js which eventually grew to a one stop shop for different Next pages such as one that utilizes openAI's API to generate an image, a page that allows you to draw on an HTML5 canvas, a garden page with webscraping data, and dynamically routing the tutorial blog texts about SSR and static generation in Next. Putting this all in one project has allowed me to take advantage of Next's great routing, rendering, and data fetching system on top of React and build a full stack system with some reusable components.
